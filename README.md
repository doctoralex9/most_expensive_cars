Cardekho Dataset Analysis
This Python script analyzes a dataset (cardekho.csv) containing information about used cars. It utilizes Pandas and Matplotlib to perform the following tasks:

1.Data Loading and Exploration:

-Reads the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
-Displays the first few rows of the DataFrame to understand its structure.

2.Data Filtering and Sorting:

-Filters the DataFrame to include only cars from the year 2017.
-Sorts the filtered data to find the most expensive cars in 2017.

3.Visualization:

-Extracts relevant columns (selling price, mileage, engine) for visualization.
-Creates a 3D scatter plot using Matplotlib to visualize relationships between price, mileage, and engine size of the most expensive cars from 2017.

Usage
Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib). Replace '/content/cardekho.csv' with the correct file path where 'cardekho.csv' is located. Run the script to load, filter, sort, and visualize the data.
